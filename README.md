# OpenMap E-Commerce Integration

## Project Overview

### Objective:
The project aims to provide a **scalable and cost-effective solution** for e-commerce applications by leveraging open-source maps for various functionalities, including polygon creation, motorable path generation, reverse-geocoding, distance computation, and mapping points to polygons or paths. The solution supports multiple representations for points, such as *GPS coordinates*, *Google S2 cells*, and *Uber H3 cells*.

### Solution Overview:
The solution utilizes open-source maps, specifically **OpenStreetMap** and **Mapbox**, to implement key functionalities. It includes components for polygon creation, motorable path generation, reverse-geocoding, distance computation, and interactive mapping of points to polygons or paths. The project adopts mapping libraries, geocoding services, and routing services to achieve its goals.

### Technologies Used:
**Mapping Libraries:**
- *OpenStreetMap* for base map data.
- *Mapbox* for additional mapping features and APIs.

**Geocoding Services:**
- *Nominatim API* for reverse-geocoding.
- *Mapbox Geocoding API* for enhanced geocoding functionalities.

**Routing Services:**
- *Mapbox Directions API* for path generation.
- Integration with other routing services based on project requirements.

### Assumptions:
1. The project assumes a stable internet connection for accessing mapping services.
2. OpenStreetMap and Mapbox APIs will be used according to their usage policies and terms.
3. User authentication and authorization will be handled separately based on the specific requirements of buyer and seller apps.
